A series of code examples from a talk on the Browser Environment from a
Systems Programmer's perspective. Uses Ruby/Sinatra for server-side code.

# Dependencies

The following third-party ruby gems are required:

* sinatra
* sinatra-websocket
* websocket-eventmachine-client

There are no javascript dependencies though a browser which fully supports
the WebSocket API is required for later examples.

# Usage
Examples can be run from the command line using:

	ruby [number].rb

or in the case of the three WebSocket clients written in ruby:

	ruby [number]_client.rb
